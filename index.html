         <h1>There are different programming languages that involve web development</h1>
     </p>

    <h2>HTML</h2>
    <p>
        HTML is the primary computer programming language used to structure websites. HTML, 
        which was created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee in the early 1990s, 
        aids in document organization and website navigation.
        HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the standard language for creating and designing content on the World Wide Web. 
        It gives web pages structure by defining features like headings, paragraphs, links, photos, and so on using a tag and 
        attribute system. 

    </p>

    <h2>Javascript</h2>
    <p>
        JavaScript is a popular web development language because of its simplicity, 
        allowing developers to construct dynamic web pages. It is also one of the world's earliest coding languages.
        Brendan Eich designed it while working at Netscape Communications Corporation, and it has since become a basic 
        technology of the World Wide Web.
        Developers can use JavaScript to control webpage content, respond to user activities, 
        change the appearance and behavior of items on a page, and interface with servers to dynamically 
        update content without reloading the entire page. It can be incorporated directly into HTML documents or 
        included as independent files that link to the HTML.
    </p>

    <h2>MYSQL</h2>
    <p>
        SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It was first developed in the 1970s and is the major language used in 
        relational databases. SQL may obtain any data from a database's tables depending on user-defined criteria. 
        The programmer must then be proficient with crafting queries that indicate what data they want from the database, 
        while SQL manages the retrieval process.
